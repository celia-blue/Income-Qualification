Project Overview
This project aims to predict income levels for households in Latin America using the Proxy Means Test (PMT) method. PMT is a popular algorithmic approach used by social programs to verify income qualification by considering observable household attributes. The model classifies households into different income levels to ensure aid is provided to those most in need.

Problem Statement 
Many social programs struggle to accurately identify the individuals or families who are eligible for assistance, particularly when dealing with the poorest segments of the population. These segments often lack the necessary documentation to prove their eligibility. This project seeks to address this issue by predicting income qualification based on household attributes.

Results 
The project illustrates how data-driven methods can be utilized to classify households into income levels, aiding social programs in the effective allocation of resources. Through exploratory data analysis on a social program dataset, SMOTEEN was applied to address class imbalance. A Random Forest model was then employed to predict household need levels using the Proxy Means Test (PMT) method, achieving a 95% accuracy rate. This approach effectively leveraged observable household attributes to ensure that aid is directed to those most in need.

Conclusion 
This project highlights the importance of data science in solving real-world problems, particularly in the field of social welfare. By predicting income levels, it provides a foundation for more accurate and fair distribution of aid.
